# DBMS mini project </br>
Our Database Management is based on the whole method of booking the tickets for the train to travel from a
particular source to destination. We are trying to make that method much more efficient and simpler by
making it online so that its available to everyone. Some of the extra service provided are the postal services
and the food where the food will be prepared freshly in the stations and when the customer enters his/her
PNR number, they will get the fresh prepared food in the upcoming station rather than food which has been
from different time by noting down their PNR and figuring out the upcoming station
